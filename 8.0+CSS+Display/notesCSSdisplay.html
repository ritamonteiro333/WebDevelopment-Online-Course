<!--example with display inline-->
<h2>Harry</h2>
<h2>Potter</h2>

h2{
    display: inline
}

<!--Result = Harry Potter-->

h2{
    display: block
    <!--It takes the entire full width of the block,
        so if another block is created it's going under the first block-->
}

<!--If it is display: inline they go side by side, in the same line, until 
    they can't fit anymore, so they go to the next line
    You can't set the size of those squares-->

<!--display: inline-block -> we can set the height and the width(block aspect) 
    and elements can go in the same line(inline aspect) -->

<!--display: none -> makes any element on the screen disappear-->
